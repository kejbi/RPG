Game is turn-based.
Every character and mob has its own stamina which is reduced with almost every activity.
When creature has not enough stamina, it can't do anything and turn ends.

Creatures can move and fight (fight has not its own system (like in M&M:Heroes ;P)). Characters can fight mobs and other characters. Mobs can attack only characters.


In the future:

-System of turns 
-A lot of expansions of characters and mobs
-more unique mobs, characters, things
-map
-etc
